We moved from the conventional in-house training (which require high machine spec) to ready-to-use APIs.\nFortunately, there are free APIs curated on OpenRouter platform. So we can build our simple chatbot without spending a penny!\nLet’s get started! 🔥\n⚡️ If you want to jump directly to the repository, you can access it here.\nProject Brief Before we start working, let’s take a look on high level concept below of how it will works. For those who are just started learning LLM, this brief information can help you to understand more how LLM-based application works.\nBasically, LLM works by taking user input and answer them based on its internal knowledge. If we want our LLM to do specific task such as brainstorming, making travel plan, calculating our expenses, or etc. we will need more advanced and structured user input. This is what we called Prompt.\nHere are very simple illustrations of the difference in user input structure when adding a prompt and not.\nHuman: Assistant: System Prompt: Human: Assistant: At this point, our LLM should be able to do specific and more advanced task. However, the LLM doesn’t remember the prior conversation and every time we invoke LLM call it assume that current user input as initial conversation with the user. To solve this problem, we need to add our previous conversation to the prompt. So that everytime we send user input, the LLM has knowledge of prior conversation which makes it remember previous conversation contexes. At the end of conversation, right after the LLM given its responses, we need to save both user input and LLM response.\nHere is the simple illustration of our system prompt which incorporating previous conversation.\nYou are professional travel planner. You are able to convert different timezone to the desired timezone quick and precisely. ... ... --------------------- Chat history: {chat_history} Pay attention that we are giving clear separation between system prompt (act as basic command) and previous chat history (as additional knowledge/context). And we put chat_history variable in curly braces that intended to be replaced with our retrieved previous conversation later. We will talk about it more in technical implementation.\nIn short, our chatbot will combine both user input and previous chat history in a prompt. Then, it will passed to LLM as the input. The LLM then responsible to generate answer based on given input. Finally, we save current conversation (user input and LLM response) as chat history which will be consumed again later.\nSetup OpenRouter API Key Mostly, each LLM has different APIs to the others. That makes switching between models become less straightforward. OpenRouter lift those problem for us by providing a unified interface which allow us to change between models easily with very minimal code changes.\nNow, to get started make sure you already created an account in https://openrouter.ai/. Then, go to Keys page and create your API Key. Remember to save it somewhere save as it won’t show twice. Start Coding! 🔥 Setup Environment In python, it is advised to create individual virtualenv to isolate our libraries. This can reduce the possibility of error due to conflict on library versions. We will use default python’s virtualenv to make one.\nRun the commands below on terminal\nmkdir simple-rag-openrouter \u0026\u0026 cd simple-rag-openrouter python -m venv venv source .venv/bin/activate After running the commands above, a new folder named venv should be appeared in our project directory. All of our installed library will be saved there.\nInstall Libraries Make sure you already activate the virtualenv. Then, run this command to install required libraries.\npip install langchain langchain_openai gradio langchain_community uuid httpx Create Project Environment Variables Now, create a new file named .env. We will store our openrouter api key and base url there. So we can ensure our published codes didn’t contains any confidential information.\nYou also may create the file using terminal\ntouch .env Then, open the .env file we just created and put our credentials there.\nOPENROUTER_BASE = \"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1\" OPENROUTER_API_KEY = \"\" To make our code reproducable by other person, let’s dump our installed python libraries to a file called requirements.txt.\npip freeze \u003e requirements.txt Building our Chatbot Interface There are a various options to build chat UI, but here we will use gradio’s ChatInterface which very handy to use.\nLet’s create a python file called main.py and put the codes below.\nimport gradio as gr from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() def predict_chat(): # TODO: we will put our LLM call here later pass with gr.Blocks(fill_height=True) as demo: chat_window = gr.Chatbot(bubble_full_width=False, render=False, scale=1) chat = gr.ChatInterface( predict_chat, chatbot=chat_window, fill_height=True, retry_btn=None, undo_btn=None, clear_btn=None ) if __name__ == \"__main__\": demo.queue() demo.launch() To run our script, run the following command in terminal.\ngradio main.py And we can already see the chat interface provided by gradio. Now, since openrouter provide a lot of LLM models we can choose and switch between them every time we want to send message. Think of the LLM here as replacable module that we can change and set to any model we want. Let’s add all available openrouter models, but limited to the free version only as we dont want to spend any money. To get the full list of available models, we can perform API request to openrouter’s endpoint here https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models. Then we can put the available models as dropdown options above the chat interface.\nFirst, create a new function to get all available free models.\nimport httpx def get_free_models(): res = httpx.get(\"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models\") if res: res = res.json() # filter only free models models = [item[\"id\"] for item in res[\"data\"] if \"free\" in item[\"id\"]] return sorted(models) Then, inside add dropdown component and populate the model names.\nwith gr.Blocks(fill_height=True) as demo: models = get_free_models() # get model names model_choice = gr.Dropdown( choices=models, # populate model names show_label=True, label=\"Model Choice\", interactive=True, value=models[0] ) Finally, add the newly added component as Chat Interface additional inputs.\nchat = gr.ChatInterface( predict_chat, chatbot=chat_window, additional_inputs=[model_choice], fill_height=True, retry_btn=None, undo_btn=None, clear_btn=None ) Our main.py file should be look like this.\nimport gradio as gr from dotenv import load_dotenv import httpx load_dotenv() def predict_chat(): # TODO: we will put our LLM call here later pass def get_free_models(): res = httpx.get(\"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models\") if res: res = res.json() # filter only free models models = [item[\"id\"] for item in res[\"data\"] if \"free\" in item[\"id\"]] return sorted(models) with gr.Blocks(fill_height=True) as demo: models = get_free_models() model_choice = gr.Dropdown( choices=models, # populate model names show_label=True, label=\"Model Choice\", interactive=True, value=models[0] ) chat_window = gr.Chatbot(bubble_full_width=False, render=False, scale=1) chat = gr.ChatInterface( predict_chat, chatbot=chat_window, additional_inputs=[model_choice], fill_height=True, retry_btn=None, undo_btn=None, clear_btn=None ) if __name__ == \"__main__\": demo.queue() demo.launch() The code above should add dropdown list with free models name available in OpenRouter. Now we have all necessary components for our UI. However, we still can’t play around with the LLMs as we haven’t put logic to handle user-chatbot interactions yet.\nLet’s add some logic there!\nAdd Chatbot Logic Remember that we’ve created a function called predict_chat() earlier? Now, to make the code cleaner we will move it to a new file named chatbot.py. We will put everything related to chatbot logic there including manage the conversation history.\nWe will use the prompt below to give specific task to the LLM.\nSystem prompt:\nYou are an AI assistant that capable to interact with users using friendly tone. Whenever you think it needed, add some emojis to your response. No need to use hashtags.\nLet’s write some codes to file chatbot.py. Don’t forget to create one if you don’t have it yet.\nFirst, let’s create a prompt template to put our prompt and user input together.\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate def predict_chat(message: str, history: list, model_name: str): prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (\"system\", \"You are an AI assistant that capable to interact with users using friendly tone. Whenever you think it needed, add some emojis to your response. No need to use hashtags.\"), (\"human\", \"{input}\") ]) Here, we are using ChatPromptTemplate as we want to format the prompt in the conversation style. There are only 3 roles available, system, human, and AI.\nThe predict_chat() function takes 3 input, namely message, history, and model_name. Both message and history is required by default as we used gradio’s ChatInterface. While the model_name came from the model names dropdown in the main.py file.\n💡 If you’re curious how in the world those dropdown input automatically required in the predict_chat function, it is because we put that component into additional_inputs in Chat Interface parameter.\nNext, let’s initiate our LLM instance. Then chain our prompt and LLM together.\nllm = ChatOpenAI( model=model_name, openai_api_key=os.getenv(\"OPENROUTER_API_KEY\"), openai_api_base=os.getenv(\"OPENROUTER_BASE\") ) # chain prompt and LLM instance using LCEL chain = prompt | llm Notice that we chain prompt and LLM together using pipe (|) symbol. Thanks to LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) we can write this handy shorthand.\nFinally, we invoke the chain in stream mode so we can see the progressive output while it generates the full response.\npartial_msg = \"\" # for chunk in history_runnable.stream({\"input\": message}, config={\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": user_id}, \"callbacks\": [ConsoleCallbackHandler()]}): for chunk in chain.stream({\"input\": message}): partial_msg = partial_msg + chunk.content yield partial_msg Our chatbot.py should be look like this now.\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI import os def predict_chat(message: str, history: list, model_name: str): prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (\"system\", \"You are an AI assistant that capable to interact with users using friendly tone. Whenever you think it needed, add some emojis to your response. No need to use hashtags.\"), (\"human\", \"{input}\") ]) llm = ChatOpenAI( model=model_name, openai_api_key=os.getenv(\"OPENROUTER_API_KEY\"), openai_api_base=os.getenv(\"OPENROUTER_BASE\") ) chain = prompt | llm partial_msg = \"\" # for chunk in history_runnable.stream({\"input\": message}, config={\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": user_id}, \"callbacks\": [ConsoleCallbackHandler()]}): for chunk in chain.stream({\"input\": message}): partial_msg = partial_msg + chunk.content yield partial_msg Now, go back for a while to main.py and add this line on import section.\nfrom chatbot import predict_chat Cool! At this point, we can start playing around with our chatbot and it will respond to our chats!\nContext-Aware Response Generation Our chatbot can respond to our question already. However, it lack of previous conversation contexes. Take a look on the captured conversation below. The previous context was talking about travel plan, but when I tried to continue the conversation it gave me an answer that doesn’t have correlation with previous context. To work on this issue, we need to put the chat history to our prompt. Here we will use SQLite as our database to save the whole chat history. Since we will only have one database for all users, we need a session_id between each user conversation history to avoid retrieving wrong user’s conversation.\nWe will first add a hidden input in chat interface that generate a unique UUID which will act as our session_id. So, everytime we refresh the page, it will generate new session_id as well.\nimport uuid with gr.Blocks(fill_height=True) as demo: user_ids = gr.Textbox(visible=False, value=uuid.uuid4()) Next, add the hidden input component as Chat Interface additional_inputs as well. So, now Chat Interface additional inputs should contains model_choice and user_ids. Otherwise, we cannot pass the value to the function predict_chat() behind.\nchat = gr.ChatInterface( predict_chat, chatbot=chat_window, additional_inputs=[model_choice, user_ids], fill_height=True, retry_btn=None, undo_btn=None, clear_btn=None ) Our final main.py should be look like this.\nimport gradio as gr from dotenv import load_dotenv import httpx from chat import predict_chat import uuid load_dotenv() def get_free_models(): res = httpx.get(\"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models\") if res: res = res.json() models = [item[\"id\"] for item in res[\"data\"] if \"free\" in item[\"id\"]] return sorted(models) with gr.Blocks(fill_height=True) as demo: user_ids = gr.Textbox(visible=False, value=uuid.uuid4()) models = get_free_models() model_choice = gr.Dropdown( choices=models, show_label=True, label=\"Model Choice\", interactive=True, value=models[0] ) chat_window = gr.Chatbot(bubble_full_width=False, render=False, scale=1) chat = gr.ChatInterface( predict_chat, chatbot=chat_window, additional_inputs=[model_choice, user_ids], fill_height=True, retry_btn=None, undo_btn=None, clear_btn=None ) if __name__ == \"__main__\": demo.queue() demo.launch() Now, we’re done with main.py. Let’s move further to chatbot.py file.\nfrom langchain_community.chat_message_histories import SQLChatMessageHistory def get_chat_history(session_id: str): chat_history = SQLChatMessageHistory( session_id=session_id, connection_string=\"sqlite:///memory.db\") return chat_history Then, we’ll a new variable named history in our prompt using MessagesPlaceholder. The rest of the prompt attribute stays the same. Also, don’t forget to add user_id to our predict_chat function parameter\ndef predict_chat(message: str, history: list, model_name: str, user_id: str): prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (\"system\", \"You are an AI assistant that capable to interact with users using friendly tone. Whenever you think it needed, add some emojis to your response. No need to use hashtags.\"), MessagesPlaceholder(\"history\"), (\"human\", \"{input}\") ]) Next, instead of we call invoke directly on chained prompt and LLM instance, we will use a new instance called RunnableWithMessageHistory.\nfrom langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory history_runnable = RunnableWithMessageHistory( chain, get_session_history=get_chat_history, input_messages_key=\"input\", history_messages_key=\"history\" ) Remember that we should always save our current conversation to database so we can use it in future interaction with chatbot? Gratefully, all those logic already handled by RunnableWithMessageHistory so we don’t have to handle it by ourselves.\nNote that we also put input and history as input and history message key respectively. Keep in mind that this key should match with variables key that already defined in prompt.\nFinally, rather than calling stream from chain, we call it from history_runnable instead. So our streaming code will look like this.\npartial_msg = \"\" for chunk in history_runnable.stream({\"input\": message}, config={\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": user_id}}): partial_msg = partial_msg + chunk.content yield partial_msg Our final main.py should be look like this.\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import SQLChatMessageHistory def get_chat_history(session_id: str): chat_history = SQLChatMessageHistory(session_id=session_id, connection_string=\"sqlite:///memory.db\") return chat_history def predict_chat(message: str, history: list, model_name: str, user_id: str): prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (\"system\", \"You are an AI assistant that capable to interact with users using friendly tone. Whenever you think it needed, add some emojis to your response. No need to use hashtags.\"), MessagesPlaceholder(\"history\"), (\"human\", \"{input}\") ]) llm = ChatOpenAI( model=model_name, openai_api_key=os.getenv(\"OPENROUTER_API_KEY\"), openai_api_base=os.getenv(\"OPENROUTER_BASE\") ) chain = prompt | llm history_runnable = RunnableWithMessageHistory( chain, get_session_history=get_chat_history, input_messages_key=\"input\", history_messages_key=\"history\" ) partial_msg = \"\" for chunk in history_runnable.stream({\"input\": message}, config={\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": user_id}}): partial_msg = partial_msg + chunk.content yield partial_msg That’s a wrap! Our chatbot now can understand previous conversation context. Super! ⚡️ Full Project https://github.com/fhrzn/study-archive/tree/master/simple-rag-openrouter\nConclusion Throughout this article, we already covered how to build a context-aware chatbot – a chatbot that understand previous conversation contexes.\nIn the upcoming article I will demonstrate how we can extend this chatbot to be able interact with external files as well such as financial reports, product catalogs, or even company profile website.\nStay tune! 👋\nReferences LangChain getting started Add message history (memory) LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) OpenRouter docs Let’s get Connected 🙌 If you have any inquiries, comments, suggestions, or critics please don’t hesitate to reach me out:\nMail: affahrizain@gmail.com LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahrizainn/ GitHub: https://github.com/fhrzn ","wordCount":"2441","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://fhrzn.github.io/posts/building-conversational-ai-context-aware-chatbot/cover.jpg","datePublished":"2024-06-01T20:00:00+07:00","dateModified":"2024-06-01T20:00:00+07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Affandy Fahrizain"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://fhrzn.github.io/posts/building-conversational-ai-context-aware-chatbot/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"fahrizain","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://fhrzn.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://fhrzn.github.io/ accesskey=h title="fahrizain (Alt + H)"><img src=https://fhrzn.github.io/favicon-32x32.png alt aria-label=logo height=30>fahrizain</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

We moved from the conventional in-house training (which require high machine spec) to ready-to-use APIs.</p><p>Fortunately, there are free APIs curated on OpenRouter platform. So we can build our simple chatbot without spending a penny!</p><p>Let&rsquo;s get started! 🔥</p><blockquote><p>⚡️ If you want to jump directly to the repository, you can access it <a href=https://github.com/fhrzn/study-archive/tree/master/simple-rag-openrouter/contextual-conversation>here</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 id=project-brief>Project Brief<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#project-brief>#</a></h2><p>Before we start working, let&rsquo;s take a look on high level concept below of how it will works.
<input type=checkbox id=zoomCheck-5390a hidden>
<label for=zoomCheck-5390a><img class=zoomCheck loading=lazy decoding=async src=images/convai_arch.png#center alt="Conversational AI Architecture"></label></p><p>For those who are just started learning LLM, this brief information can help you to understand more how LLM-based application works.</p><p>Basically, LLM works by taking user input and answer them based on its internal knowledge. If we want our LLM to do specific task such as brainstorming, making travel plan, calculating our expenses, or etc. we will need more advanced and structured user input. This is what we called <strong>Prompt</strong>.</p><p>Here are very simple illustrations of the difference in user input structure when adding a prompt and not.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Human: &lt;user query/input here&gt;
Assistant: &lt;chatbot answer here&gt;
</code></pre><pre tabindex=0><code>System Prompt: &lt;system prompt here&gt;
Human: &lt;user query/input here&gt;
Assistant: &lt;chatbot answer here&gt;
</code></pre><p>At this point, our LLM should be able to do specific and more advanced task. However, the LLM doesn&rsquo;t remember the prior conversation and every time we invoke LLM call it assume that current user input as initial conversation with the user. To solve this problem, we need to add our previous conversation to the prompt. So that everytime we send user input, the LLM has knowledge of prior conversation which makes it <em>remember</em> previous conversation contexes. At the end of conversation, right after the LLM given its responses, we need to save both user input and LLM response.</p><p>Here is the simple illustration of our system prompt which incorporating previous conversation.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>You are professional travel planner. You are able to convert different timezone to the desired timezone quick and precisely.
...
...
---------------------
Chat history:
{chat_history}
</code></pre><p>Pay attention that we are giving clear separation between system prompt (act as basic command) and previous chat history (as additional knowledge/context). And we put <code>chat_history</code> variable in curly braces that intended to be replaced with our retrieved previous conversation later. We will talk about it more in technical implementation.</p><p>In short, our chatbot will combine both user input and previous chat history in a prompt. Then, it will passed to LLM as the input. The LLM then responsible to generate answer based on given input. Finally, we save current conversation (user input and LLM response) as chat history which will be consumed again later.</p><h2 id=setup-openrouter-api-key>Setup OpenRouter API Key<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#setup-openrouter-api-key>#</a></h2><p>Mostly, each LLM has different APIs to the others. That makes switching between models become less straightforward. OpenRouter lift those problem for us by providing a unified interface which allow us to change between models easily with very minimal code changes.</p><p>Now, to get started make sure you already created an account in <a href=https://openrouter.ai/>https://openrouter.ai/</a>. Then, go to <a href=https://openrouter.ai/keys>Keys page</a> and create your API Key. Remember to save it somewhere save as it won&rsquo;t show twice.
