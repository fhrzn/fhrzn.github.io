Initially, there was a long process in our system, and the execution time is not deterministic. Making the some request caught in the timeout error. To solve it, we come up with a message broker based solution.\nIn this case, our system has to communicate with itself to do the long process in the background. So the origin request won’t be expired. Optionally, once the process is done it can be asked to notify the user.\nThe illustration of our FastAPI interaction with RabbitMQ producer and consumer.\nPub/Sub Pattern The publisher/subscriber pattern using message broker is one of the common pattern. It also covered in the official documentation of RabbitMQ. However, the common pattern is to have publisher and consumer as different application because usually the communication is happened between two or more services. While in our case, we don’t want to create another service just for processing our task in background. Therefore, we need to have both publisher and subscriber in a single service.\nUsually, in more complex system there could be multiple publisher and subscriber for different events. But in this case, we will demonstrate it using only one publisher and subscriber which we will call it as producer and consumer. The simple illustration of single pub/sub.\nIntegration with FastAPI Initially, I did my experiments by running producer and consumer in dedicated threads; and using asyncio connection. The threads solution always gave me an error pika.exceptions.StreamLostError: Stream connection lost: BrokenPipeError(32, 'Broken pipe') after idle for several minutes. While the asyncio based one always blocking the same thread that used to serve endpoint routes. Meaning when the background process is running, any calls to the endpoints should be wait for it to be finished.\nFinally, I found the solution using aio-pika library, and the decided to built my solution on top of it. So, let’s start demonstrate it using simple FastAPI project.\nNote: I won’t explain basic terms and definitions of each RMQ part. Feel free to visit their official tutorial to better understand the terms and definitions\nRabbitMQ (Pika) documentation\naio-pika documentation\nFirst thing first, lets create a rmq.py file for our PikaClient which will be interact with RMQ.\nimport logging import aio_pika import asyncio logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) class PikaClient(): def __init__(self, queue_name: str, exchange_name: str, conn_str: str) -\u003e None: self.queue_name = queue_name self.exchange_name = exchange_name self.conn_str = conn_str self.connection = None self.channel = None self.exchange = None self.queue = None async def start_connection(self): logger.info(\"Starting a new connection\") self.connection = await aio_pika.connect_robust(url=self.conn_str) logger.info(\"Opening a new channel\") self.channel = await self.connection.channel() logger.info(\"Declaring an exchange: %s\" % self.exchange_name) self.exchange = await self.channel.declare_exchange(name=self.exchange_name, type=aio_pika.ExchangeType.DIRECT) await self.setup_queue() async def setup_queue(self): logger.info(\"Setup a queue: %s\" % self.queue_name) self.queue = await self.channel.declare_queue(name=self.queue_name) logger.info(\"Bind queue to exchange\") await self.queue.bind(self.exchange) async def disconnect(self): try: if not self.connection.is_closed: await self.connection.close() except Exception as _e: logger.error(_e) Here we just created the basic interface for interacting with RMQ. It consists of starting a new RMQ connection, opening a new channel, declaring an exchange, and setup a queue.\nThen, let’s add the following functions to enable run PikaClient as producer.\nasync def start_producer(self): await self.start_connection() logger.info(\"Producer has been started\") return self async def publish_message(self, message): await self.exchange.publish( aio_pika.Message(body=message.encode()), routing_key=self.queue_name ) Once the client is connected and ran in producer mode, it can call publish_message() at any time to send the message to RMQ.\nNow, let’s continue add the following functions for enabling run as consumer.\nasync def start_consumer(self): await self.start_connection() await self.channel.set_qos(prefetch_count=1) logger.info(\"Starting consumer\") await self.queue.consume(self.handle_message) logger.info(\"Consumer has been started\") return self async def handle_message(self, message: aio_pika.abc.AbstractIncomingMessage): # simulating long process await asyncio.sleep(10) logger.info(\"Consumer: Got message from producer: %s\" % message.body.decode()) await message.ack() Here, we need to set few things up at the initial connection.\nThe channel.set_qos() define how many job allowed to be executed concurrently. The queue.consume(callback) trigger the consumer to subscribe/listen to the predefined queue, waiting for any new message.\nThe callback function (in this case handle_message()) is executed rightaway the message arrived in RMQ. Note that we simulating the long background process using asyncio.sleep(10). Later you will see that during long process simulation, the user still able to navigate through our endpoints without getting blcoked.\nFinally, message.ack() is used to mark that the message is received successfully.\nNow, let’s move to main.py and setup our FastAPI application.\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response import logging from rmq import PikaClient logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\"%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(name)s - %(message)s\") logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) app = FastAPI() @app.on_event(\"startup\") async def start_rmq(): pass @app.on_event(\"shutdown\") async def shutdown_rmq(): pass @app.get(\"/\") def root(response: Response): response.status_code = 200 logger.info(\"hit root endpoint\") return {\"status_code\": 200, \"message\": \"Hello!\"} @app.get(\"/send-message\") async def send_message(request: Request, response: Response): pass Here, we will have 2 endpoints for demonstrating our background jobs and regular endpoint for which user or another service can interact with our system. We also have both startup and shutdown FastAPI event which we will use it to start and stop our RMQ producer and consumer.\nLet’s start with setup the producer.\n@app.on_event(\"startup\") async def start_rmq(): # start producer app.rmq_producer = PikaClient(queue_name=\"test.queue\", exchange_name=\"test.exchange\", conn_str=\"amqp://root:root@127.0.0.1:5672\") await app.rmq_producer.start_producer() @app.on_event(\"shutdown\") async def shutdown_rmq(): await app.rmq_producer.disconnect() Quite simple, once the application start it will create a PikaClient object and call start_producer() to run it as producer. And once the application is stopped it will call the disconnect() to stop the producer.\nNow, let’s implement the similar thing to consumer with slight difference. We will run the consumer in a different thread so it won’t block the thread that FastAPI used for serving endpoint routes.\ndef start_background_loop(loop: asyncio.AbstractEventLoop) -\u003e None: # inspired from https://gist.github.com/dmfigol/3e7d5b84a16d076df02baa9f53271058 asyncio.set_event_loop(loop) loop.run_forever() @app.on_event(\"startup\") async def start_rmq(): # start producer app.rmq_producer = PikaClient(queue_name=\"test.queue\", exchange_name=\"test.exchange\", conn_str=\"amqp://root:root@127.0.0.1:5672\") await app.rmq_producer.start_producer() # start consumer in other thread app.rmq_consumer = PikaClient(queue_name=\"test.queue\", exchange_name=\"test.exchange\", conn_str=\"amqp://root:root@127.0.0.1:5672\") app.consumer_loop = asyncio.new_event_loop() tloop = threading.Thread(target=start_background_loop, args=(app.consumer_loop,), daemon=True) tloop.start() _ = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(app.rmq_consumer.start_consumer(), app.consumer_loop) @app.on_event(\"shutdown\") async def shutdown_rmq(): await app.rmq_producer.disconnect() await app.rmq_consumer.disconnect() app.consumer_loop.stop() Here, inside the startup event we initiated a new asyncio event loop. Then, we trigger that loop to be run from another thread. We then delegate the start_consumer() calls to the loop, so the consumer will executed in the newly created thread. Finally, inside the shutdown event, we also call disconnect() to stop consumer RMQ from subscribing the queue. And we also trigger our created asyncio event loop to stop.\nThe final codes would be like this.\nrmq.py\nimport logging import aio_pika import asyncio logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) class PikaClient(): def __init__(self, queue_name: str, exchange_name: str, conn_str: str) -\u003e None: self.queue_name = queue_name self.exchange_name = exchange_name self.conn_str = conn_str self.connection = None self.channel = None self.exchange = None self.queue = None async def start_connection(self): logger.info(\"Starting a new connection\") self.connection = await aio_pika.connect_robust(url=self.conn_str) logger.info(\"Opening a new channel\") self.channel = await self.connection.channel() logger.info(\"Declaring an exchange: %s\" % self.exchange_name) self.exchange = await self.channel.declare_exchange(name=self.exchange_name, type=aio_pika.ExchangeType.DIRECT) await self.setup_queue() async def setup_queue(self): logger.info(\"Setup a queue: %s\" % self.queue_name) self.queue = await self.channel.declare_queue(name=self.queue_name) logger.info(\"Bind queue to exchange\") await self.queue.bind(self.exchange) async def start_producer(self): await self.start_connection() logger.info(\"Producer has been started\") return self async def publish_message(self, message): await self.exchange.publish( aio_pika.Message(body=message.encode()), routing_key=self.queue_name ) async def start_consumer(self): await self.start_connection() await self.channel.set_qos(prefetch_count=1) logger.info(\"Starting consumer\") await self.queue.consume(self.handle_message) logger.info(\"Consumer has been started\") return self async def handle_message(self, message: aio_pika.abc.AbstractIncomingMessage): # simulating long process await asyncio.sleep(10) logger.info(\"Consumer: Got message from producer: %s\" % message.body.decode()) await message.ack() async def disconnect(self): try: if not self.connection.is_closed: await self.connection.close() except Exception as _e: logger.error(_e) main.py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response import asyncio import logging from rmq import PikaClient import threading logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\"%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(name)s - %(message)s\") logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) app = FastAPI() def start_background_loop(loop: asyncio.AbstractEventLoop) -\u003e None: # inspired from https://gist.github.com/dmfigol/3e7d5b84a16d076df02baa9f53271058 asyncio.set_event_loop(loop) loop.run_forever() @app.on_event(\"startup\") async def start_rmq(): # start producer app.rmq_producer = PikaClient(queue_name=\"test.queue\", exchange_name=\"test.exchange\", conn_str=\"amqp://root:root@127.0.0.1:5672\") await app.rmq_producer.start_producer() # start consumer in other thread app.rmq_consumer = PikaClient(queue_name=\"test.queue\", exchange_name=\"test.exchange\", conn_str=\"amqp://root:root@127.0.0.1:5672\") app.consumer_loop = asyncio.new_event_loop() tloop = threading.Thread(target=start_background_loop, args=(app.consumer_loop,), daemon=True) tloop.start() _ = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(app.rmq_consumer.start_consumer(), app.consumer_loop) @app.on_event(\"shutdown\") async def shutdown_rmq(): await app.rmq_producer.disconnect() await app.rmq_consumer.disconnect() app.consumer_loop.stop() @app.get(\"/\") def root(response: Response): response.status_code = 200 logger.info(\"hit root endpoint\") return {\"status_code\": 200, \"message\": \"Hello!\"} @app.get(\"/send-message\") async def send_message(request: Request, response: Response): message = \"Hello from RMQ producer!\" response.status_code = 202 logger.info(\"message sent\") await request.app.rmq_producer.publish_message(message) return {\"status_code\": 202, \"message\": \"Your message has been sent.\"} Running the Application When we start the server, shortly we will notice both producer and consumer has started. Now, lets try to hit the long process endpoint following by several hits to the ordinary endpoint. Let’s try several more then observe our RMQ dashboard. And we can see there are some messages incoming and being processed.\nConclusion Now we know how to integrate both RMQ based publisher and subscriber within single FastAPI app.\nIf you have any inquiries, comments, suggestions, or critics please don’t hesitate to reach me out:\nMail: affahrizain@gmail.com LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahrizainn/ GitHub: https://github.com/fhrzn Until next time! 👋\nReferences https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html https://aio-pika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start.html#asynchronous-message-processing RabbitMQ publisher and consumer with FastAPI by IT racer Gist python asyncio event loop in a separated thread by dmfigol ","wordCount":"1477","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pain-free-python-fastapi-rmq-integration/cover.jpeg","datePublished":"2024-02-10T06:55:09+07:00","dateModified":"2024-02-10T06:55:09+07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Affandy Fahrizain"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pain-free-python-fastapi-rmq-integration/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"fahrizain","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="fahrizain (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/favicon-32x32.png alt aria-label=logo height=30>fahrizain</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
