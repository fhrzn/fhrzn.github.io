Generally, there are two popular basic variant of Generative AI: Autoencoders network and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In this series, we will discover the former one and leave the latter in another one.\nAutoencoder Network Autoencoder is a neural network architecture that learn representation (encode) the input data, then tries to reconstruct the original data as close as possible by leveraging the learned representation (encoded) data. It is useful for denoising image, reduce dimensionality, or detecting outlier.\nThis network mainly consist of three parts: Encoder network, Decoder network, and Latent Space; each of them play an important role to make the model works. Let’s breakdown each of them below.\nEncoder Network Encoder network is responsible to take an input data, then compress it into smaller representation of data (latent space). The layer size of this network usually shrinks as it closer to the last layer that produce the latent space. It is inline with our human intuition where compress means to make things smaller, and in this case, it is works by passing the input data to hidden layers which shrinks at each stage.\nLatent Space Latent space is the encoder outputs, which we can also call it learned representation. It is actually the collection of vectors just like the input data, but in smaller dimension. In my opinion, the latent space has smaller dimension as it is only keep the important parts of the input data. These important parts were selected and evaluated in every step of forward propagation in the encoder network, hence producing such smaller representation.\nThis smaller representation later will be consumed as input for the decoder network.\nDecoder Network In contrast to the encoder network, decoder network is responsible to reconstruct (decode) the learned representation to be as close as possible with the original input data. Instead of using the original input data, this network use the latent space as its input. It also means the decoder network forced to generate new data based on those representation (which hopefully representing the input data enough). Finally, in each training step the generated data will be compared to the original one until it is already close enough.\nLoss Function As we mentioned earlier, the generated data needs to be compared with the original one to ensure it closeness. To do that, we need to define specific loss function which can be different for each field (e.g. image, text, audio). In this case, we will use image data for our discussion.\nNow, to measure the closeness between generated and original images, we can employ MSE Loss below.\n$$ MSE = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 $$\nwhere:\n$N:$ is the total samples\n$y_i:$ is the original input data\n$\\hat{y_i}:$ is the reconstructed data\nApplication of Autoencoder Dimensionality Reduction: similar to PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which useful for visualization purpose. Feature Extraction: generate the compressed latent representation to be used for the downstream tasks such as classification or prediction. The base model of BERT, GPT2, and its family is the examples of this application. File Compression: by reducing the data dimensionality we are able to reconstruct data with smaller size (but also risk some data quality). Image Denoising: remove the noise of the image that might be produced by high ISO or corrupted image. In order to do that, we must train the model to learn the difference between the clean image and the noisy one. Once trained, it expected able to reconstruct image with less noise. Image Generator: able to generate or modify images that are similar to input data. It used the variant of autoencoder named Variational Autoencoder (VAE). It is also useful for data augmentation. Coding Time! In this article, we will try to make our very first autoencoder. We will start with the simple one using Linear layers to compress the EMNIST letter images.\nIf you are prefer to jump ahead into the notebook, please visit this link.\nDataset Preparation First of all, let’s import and create config for our training purpose.\n# data manipulation import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd # utils import os import gzip import string from tqdm.auto import tqdm import time # pytorch import torch from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader from torch import nn import torch.nn.functional as F from torchvision.transforms import transforms from torchvision import datasets class config: batch_size = 512 device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu' epochs = 20 learning_rate = 1e-3 log_step = 100 seed=42 latent_dim = 32 inp_out_dim = 784 hidden_dim = 128 When I explored the dataset, I found the original images were flipped and rotated like this.\nTherefore, we need to fix it into correct direction. Fortunately, torchvision has very helpful utilities to perform data transformation.\n# transform data transform = transforms.Compose([ transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(1), # we need to flip and rotate cz the transforms.RandomRotation((90,90)), # original img was flip and rotated. transforms.ToTensor() ]) There, we define 3 transformations.\nRandomHorizontalFlip: flip image horizontally. This function require a parameter of probability of an image being flipped. Here we need all images to be flipped, therefore we fixed the probability to 1. RandomRotation: rotate image by angle. This function require sequence number of angles, if we put only single number it will assume the rotation degree ranging from (-degrees, +degrees). Since we need all images to be rotated in the same direction, we fixed the degrees by feeding sequences (tuple) of 90. ToTensor: convert images to tensor and scale it to range (0, 1) at the same time. Now, lets download EMNIST data and put our defined transformation here. Don’t forget to set the splits into letters as we want to reconstruct letters data instead of numbers.\n# load EMNIST data train_data = datasets.EMNIST(root='data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform, split='letters') test_data = datasets.EMNIST(root='data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform, split='letters') With the transformation applied, now if we interpret our data it will be in the correct direction.\nNext, let’s prepare our dataloaders!\n# setup the dataloaders trainloader = DataLoader(train_data, shuffle=True, batch_size=config.batch_size) testloader = DataLoader(test_data, shuffle=True, batch_size=config.batch_size) Designing Model Architecture Now, we are close enough to the fun part. But before that, let’s build our model architecture first. Here we will use Linear Layer for both our Encoder and Decoder networks. Remember that our data is scaled within range (0,1). Therefore, we should put Sigmoid layer in the very last part of Decoder network.\nclass LinearAutoencoder(nn.Module): def __init__(self, inp_out_dim, hidden_dim, latent_dim): super(LinearAutoencoder, self).__init__() # encoder layer to latent space self.encoder = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(inp_out_dim, hidden_dim), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(hidden_dim, latent_dim) ) # latent space to decoder layer self.decoder = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(latent_dim, hidden_dim), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(hidden_dim, inp_out_dim), nn.Sigmoid() # we use sigmoid cz the input and output should be in range 0,1 ) def forward(self, x): # pass input to encoder and activate it with ReLU x = self.encoder(x) # pass latent space to decoder and scale it with Sigmoid x = self.decoder(x) return x Let’s define our model and interpret its architecture.\n# define model model = LinearAutoencoder(inp_out_dim=config.inp_out_dim, hidden_dim=config.hidden_dim, latent_dim=config.latent_dim) # move to GPU device model = model.to(config.device) print(model) # our model architecture LinearAutoencoder( (encoder): Sequential( (0): Linear(in_features=784, out_features=128, bias=True) (1): ReLU() (2): Linear(in_features=128, out_features=32, bias=True) ) (decoder): Sequential( (0): Linear(in_features=32, out_features=128, bias=True) (1): ReLU() (2): Linear(in_features=128, out_features=784, bias=True) (3): Sigmoid() ) ) Take a look for a while in our model architecture.\nInitially our model will accept the input image within the shape of (batch_size, 784). For those who are wondering why is it 784 and not other value, well, it is actually obtained from 28 * 28 which our original image size.\nA little explanation…\nFor better intuition, let me break down a little bit for this part.\nBy default, our data is arranged with the following shape format (batch_size, color_channel, height, width). If you take a batch from our trainloader, you will observe that our dataset having shape like this.\ntorch.Size([512, 1, 28, 28])\nThen, we need to flatten it into 2-d array. So, later we will have dataset within shape (512, 784) which then will fed to our model.\nNow, back to our model architecture.\nInstead of having single Linear Layer, we stack it with another hidden layer on each Encoder and Decoder network. You may try to modify the dimension of hidden layer by changing hidden_dim value in config.\nThen, from hidden layer, we produce a latent representation within size dimension of 32. You also may modify it by changing latent_dim in config. Finally, the latent space will be act as the input of Decoder network.\n💡 Note that the Encoder network should be shrinking to its end and the opposite for the Decoder network as our objective is to compress the images.\nTraining Model And we arrived to the most interesting part. Here we define our loss function (criterion), optimizer, and training function.\n# loss and optimizer criterion = nn.MSELoss() optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=config.learning_rate) # logging history = { 'train_loss': [] } # progressbar num_train_steps = len(trainloader) * config.epochs progressbar = tqdm(range(num_train_steps)) # training function epochtime = time.time() for epoch in range(config.epochs): trainloss = 0 batchtime = time.time() for idx, batch in enumerate(trainloader): # unpack data features, _ = batch features = features.to(config.device) # reshape input data into (batch_size x 784) features = features.view(features.size(0), -1) # clear gradient optimizer.zero_grad() # forward pass output = model(features) # calculate loss loss = criterion(output, features) loss.backward() # optimize optimizer.step() # update running training loss trainloss += loss.item() # update progressbar progressbar.update(1) progressbar.set_postfix_str(f\"Loss: {loss.item()}:.3f\") # log step if idx % config.log_step == 0: print(\"Epoch: %03d/%03d | Batch: %04d/%04d | Loss: %.4f\" \\ % ((epoch+1), config.epochs, idx, \\ len(trainloader), trainloss / (idx + 1))) # log epoch history['train_loss'].append(trainloss / len(trainloader)) print(\"***Epoch: %03d/%03d | Loss: %.3f\" \\ % ((epoch+1), config.epochs, loss.item())) # log time print('Time elapsed: %.2f min' % ((time.time() - batchtime) / 60)) print('Total Training Time: %.2f min' % ((time.time() - epochtime) / 60)) Here we will train for 20 epochs in total, and we log our model performances to console for every 100 training steps.\nAdditionally, we can also plot our training history to get better understanding on model performance.\nplt.figure(figsize=(5, 7)) plt.plot(range(len(history['train_loss'])), history['train_loss'], label='Train Loss') plt.xlabel('Epochs') plt.ylabel('MSE Loss') plt.legend() plt.show() After training for several epochs, we then evaluate it on our test set. Don’t forget to turn off the gradient by putting torch.no_grad() during evaluation since we don’t need any backpropagation process.\n# evaluate model testloss = 0 testtime = time.time() for batch in tqdm(testloader): # unpack data test_feats, _ = batch # reshape image test_feats = test_feats.view(test_feats.size(0), -1).to(config.device) # forward pass with torch.no_grad(): test_out = model(test_feats) # compute loss loss = criterion(test_out, test_feats) testloss += loss.item() print('Test Loss: %.4f' % (testloss / len(testloader))) print('Total Testing Time: %.2f min' % ((time.time() - testtime) / 60)) Inference It’s time to use our human intuition to see how good our model compression’s result. Let’s take a batch from the test set and compress it with our model.\n# obtain one batch of test images test_feats, test_labels = next(iter(testloader)) original_img = test_feats.numpy() # reshape image test_feats = test_feats.view(test_feats.size(0), -1).to(config.device) # forward pass with torch.no_grad(): infer_output = model(test_feats).detach().cpu() # resize outputs back to batch of images reconstructed_img = infer_output.view(config.batch_size, 1, 28, 28).numpy() Finally, we will compare both original data and the compressed one.\n# plot the first ten input images and the reconstructed images fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 10, sharex=True, sharey=True, figsize=(25, 4)) # input images on top, reconstruction on bottom for idx, (images, row) in enumerate(zip([original_img, reconstructed_img], axes)): for img, lbl, ax in zip(images, test_labels, row): ax.imshow(img.squeeze(), cmap=plt.cm.binary) if idx == 0: ax.set_title(f\"Label: {alphabets[lbl-1]}\") ax.get_xaxis().set_visible(False) ax.get_yaxis().set_visible(False) Save Model Lastly, if we are satisfied already with our model performance, we can save it. So we can use it anytime later without needing to run through all the codes above.\ntorch.save(model.state_dict(), 'emnist-linear-autoencoder.pt') Conclusion So we already discussed the Autoencoder network which also a family of Generative AI. It consists of 3 main parts: Encoder network, Decoder network, and the Latent representation. We also covered the implementation of Autoencoder using simple stacks of Linear Layer.\nAlthough simple network, our model performs quite good on test set and able to compress and reconstruct letter images.\nIf you have any inquiries, comments, suggestions, or critics please don’t hesitate to reach me out:\nMail: affahrizain@gmail.com LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahrizainn/ GitHub: https://github.com/fhrzn Cheers! 🥂\nReferences https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/autoencoders-a-gentle-introduction/ https://structilmy.com/blog/2020/03/17/pengenalan-autoencoder-neural-network-untuk-kompresi-data/ https://medium.com/@samuelsena/pengenalan-deep-learning-part-6-deep-autoencoder-40d79e9c7866 https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/autoencoder https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/autoencoder/linear-autoencoder https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=345wRyqKkQ0\u0026list=PLTKMiZHVd_2KJtIXOW0zFhFfBaJJilH51\u0026index=138 https://github.com/rasbt/stat453-deep-learning-ss21/tree/main/L16 ","wordCount":"2102","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/posts/autoencoders-your-first-step-into-generative-ai/cover.jpg","datePublished":"2024-01-02T21:00:00+07:00","dateModified":"2024-01-02T21:00:00+07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Affandy Fahrizain"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/autoencoders-your-first-step-into-generative-ai/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"fahrizain","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="fahrizain (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/favicon-32x32.png alt aria-label=logo height=30>fahrizain</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

It is actually the collection of vectors just like the input data, but in smaller dimension. In my opinion, the latent space has smaller dimension as it is only keep the important parts of the input data. These important parts were selected and evaluated in every step of <em>forward propagation</em> in the encoder network, hence producing such smaller representation.</p><p>This smaller representation later will be consumed as input for the decoder network.</p><h3 id=decoder-network>Decoder Network<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#decoder-network>#</a></h3><p>In contrast to the encoder network, decoder network is responsible to reconstruct <em>(decode)</em> the learned representation to be as close as possible with the original input data. Instead of using the original input data, this network use the latent space as its input. It also means the decoder network forced to <em>generate</em> new data based on those representation (which hopefully representing the input data enough). Finally, in each training step the generated data will be compared to the original one until it is already close enough.</p><h3 id=loss-function>Loss Function<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#loss-function>#</a></h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, the generated data needs to be compared with the original one to ensure it closeness. To do that, we need to define specific loss function which can be different for each field (e.g. image, text, audio). In this case, we will use image data for our discussion.</p><p>Now, to measure the closeness between generated and original images, we can employ MSE Loss below.</p><p>$$
MSE = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
$$</p><p>where:</p><p>$N:$ is the total samples</p><p>$y_i:$ is the original input data</p><p>$\hat{y_i}:$ is the reconstructed data</p><h2 id=application-of-autoencoder>Application of Autoencoder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#application-of-autoencoder>#</a></h2><ol><li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> similar to PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which useful for visualization purpose.</li><li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> generate the compressed latent representation to be used for the downstream tasks such as classification or prediction. The base model of BERT, GPT2, and its family is the examples of this application.</li><li><strong>File Compression:</strong> by reducing the data dimensionality we are able to reconstruct data with smaller size (but also risk some data quality).</li><li><strong>Image Denoising:</strong> remove the noise of the image that might be produced by high ISO or corrupted image. In order to do that, we must train the model to learn the difference between the clean image and the noisy one. Once trained, it expected able to reconstruct image with less noise.</li><li><strong>Image Generator:</strong> able to generate or modify images that are similar to input data. It used the variant of autoencoder named Variational Autoencoder (VAE). It is also useful for data augmentation.</li></ol><h2 id=coding-time>Coding Time!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#coding-time>#</a></h2><p>In this article, we will try to make our very first autoencoder.

So, later we will have dataset within shape (512, 784) which then will fed to our model.</p></blockquote><p>Now, back to our model architecture.</p><p>Instead of having single Linear Layer, we stack it with another hidden layer on each Encoder and Decoder network. You may try to modify the dimension of hidden layer by changing <code>hidden_dim</code> value in <code>config</code>.</p><p>Then, from hidden layer, we produce a latent representation within size dimension of 32.

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p>So we already discussed the Autoencoder network which also a family of Generative AI. It consists of 3 main parts: Encoder network, Decoder network, and the Latent representation. We also covered the implementation of Autoencoder using simple stacks of Linear Layer.</p><p>Although simple network, our model performs quite good on test set and able to compress and reconstruct letter images.</p><p>If you have any inquiries, comments, suggestions, or critics please don’t hesitate to reach me out:</p><ul><li>Mail: <a href=mailto:affahrizain@gmail.com>affahrizain@gmail.com</a></li><li>LinkedIn: <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahrizainn/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahrizainn/</a></li><li>GitHub: <a href=https://github.com/fhrzn>https://github.com/fhrzn</a></li></ul><p>Cheers! 🥂</p><hr><h2 id=references>References<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#references>#</a></h2><ol><li><a href=https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/autoencoders-a-gentle-introduction/>https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/autoencoders-a-gentle-introduction/</a></li><li><a href=https://structilmy.com/blog/2020/03/17/pengenalan-autoencoder-neural-network-untuk-kompresi-data/>https://structilmy.com/blog/2020/03/17/pengenalan-autoencoder-neural-network-untuk-kompresi-data/</a></li><li><a href=https://medium.com/@samuelsena/pengenalan-deep-learning-part-6-deep-autoencoder-40d79e9c7866>https://medium.com/@samuelsena/pengenalan-deep-learning-part-6-deep-autoencoder-40d79e9c7866</a></li><li><a href=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/autoencoder>https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/autoencoder</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/autoencoder/linear-autoencoder>https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/autoencoder/linear-autoencoder</a></li><li><a href=https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset>https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=345wRyqKkQ0&amp;list=PLTKMiZHVd_2KJtIXOW0zFhFfBaJJilH51&amp;index=138">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=345wRyqKkQ0&amp;list=PLTKMiZHVd_2KJtIXOW0zFhFfBaJJilH51&amp;index=138</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/rasbt/stat453-deep-learning-ss21/tree/main/L16>https://github.com/rasbt/stat453-deep-learning-ss21/tree/main/L16</a></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/deeplearning/>Deeplearning</a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/representation/>Representation</a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/autoencoder/>Autoencoder</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=http://localhost:1313/posts/restore-your-noisy-image-using-autoencoders/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Restore your Noisy Image Using Autoencoders</span>
